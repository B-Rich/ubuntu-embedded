For your first boot (and only for it), to complete the installation process,
follow these instructions:

insert the sd card in your cubox, turn it on, stop the boot
process when you see the countdown message and type in:

env default -a
setenv mmcroot "/dev/mmcblk0p1 rootwait rw"
saveenv
boot

That's it, if your board is booting now, you successfully completed the
installation of Ubuntu for your Cubox, enjoy it!
